        Usage: bvwack
        <options>


            Default action is equivalent to bvwack -n 2

            Options:
            -b BASE_DIR, --base-dir BASE_DIR Set BASE_DIR instead of /Volumes/thundar/media/video
            -d, --dry-run Do a dry run. Prints proposed commands to STDOUT.
            -c, --clean-up Instead of converting, move all converted files to
            /Volumes/thundar/media/converted/[old-path]
            -n #, --num-files # Number of videos to batch.
            -l, --list_converted Lists files that have been converted but not cleaned. Useful for vierifying successful
            conversion.

            Notes: By default this will not work for you. You must change DEFAULT_CONVERT_BASE_DIR
            and DEFAULT_CLEAN_BASE_DIR to something that exists on your system. Do not let
            the clean dir be a subdirectory of base dir or you'll be sad. I have set the
            FFMPEG options to use only 2 threads. This allows me to use my laptop while
            converting things. If you just want to hog through video try setting -threads 0
            in FFMPEG_OPTS. Currently this only works on UNIX-like systems.

            Requirements: ffmpeg and a libx264-slow.ffpreset (possibly in your ~/.ffmpeg/ directory or in your Cellar if
            you use brew.) Google is your friend.

            Examples:
            bvwack -dw Shows proposed commands for 2 videos
            bvwack -w -b somedir/anotherdir -n 5 Converts 5 videos under somedir/anotherdir
            bvwack -c -n 10 Moves 10 already converted mkv or avi files to /Volumes/thundar/medai/converted/[od-path]"
